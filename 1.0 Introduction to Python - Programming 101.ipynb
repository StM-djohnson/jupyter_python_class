    "## Introduction to Python\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a great *interpreted* programming language to start programming in. *Interpreted* means the programs do not need to be compiled, but instead run through a Python interpreter running on your system. Python is very easy to learn, but due to it's extensibility is also a very powerful language to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be running Python in Jupyter Notebooks - these have become very popular with data scientists as a way to mix text and programming in a single document. Again, because Python is interpreted, we can write Python code in the notebook and have it run on the server, and show results right in the notebook! Let's take a look at our first Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your Hello World program\n",
    "\n",
    "It is standard when learning any new program to have your first task be outputting \"Hello World\". While simple, this kind of example shows you how to make the language show you some form of input. We will extend the example further on."

    "\n",
    "This program ```print(\"Hello World\")``` does quite a bit for a simple line of code - we are introduced to the ```print()``` command, which sends whatever is inside the parentheses to the 'system standard output' - in our case a webpage, but it could be an LCD scroll, a log file, a terminal line, etc. ```print()``` is a command - it contains a directive ('print'), and acts on it's **argument**, which in our case is ```\"Hello World\"```\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice the words ```Hello World``` were contained within double quotes - this marks the value as a **String**, which in programming is a 'string' of characters that are meant to be used *as they are* - nothing is done to a simple string. There are plenty of other data types, and each programming language can have it's own data types. For example, Python has an Integer type, and we can use it very simply:\n"
